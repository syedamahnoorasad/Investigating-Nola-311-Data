    "## Dataset Choice\n",
    "I am using NOLA 311 Calls/Requests Dataset from 2012-2026. The dataset consist of records produced by the residents of New Orleans who submit their non-emergency problems to the city government. The data is available publicly at: https://data.nola.gov/City-Administration/311-OPCD-Calls-2012-Present-/2jgv-pqrq/data_preview. I downloaded the data in CSV format which I later import into a dataframe using pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am picking this dataset due to these reasons:\n",
    "1. It relates to New Orleans so it hits close to home.\n",
    "2. This data is massive and at the time of downloading had over 900,000 records. \n",
    "3. It is geenrally fairly organized but has issues with consistency, tidiness, and missing fields which make it a great candidate for pre-processing.\n",
    "4. Within this data there are several different categories of issues reported. Such as entries pertaining to sewerage, parking, accessibility, electricity and so on. These sub-categories can be relevant and interesting. \n",
    "5. It is real, and open-government data that can lead to practical insights depicting real world trends. \n",
    "6. My own Phd research is based around civic data and I think this is very in line and relevant to that. It will be helpful for me to investigate a data like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Plan\n",
    "For this project, I want to build a public, end-to-end walkthrough that starts with data extraction, continues through cleaning and exploratory analysis, and ends with a clear managerial insight. I am currently considering three realistic datasets and will finalize one after deeper quality checks.\n",
